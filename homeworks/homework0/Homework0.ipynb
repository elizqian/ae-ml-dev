    "This homework is designed as a quick and easy intro to Python. If you spend more than a few hours on this assignment, this class will likely be quite difficult for you. If anywhere in this homework you see a \"What do you notice?\" or a \"What happens?\" question at the end of the bulletpoint, you do not need to explicitly answer these. They are for you to think about on your own. If we do desire a response from you, there will be a designated **Free Response** section for you to complete it. \n",
