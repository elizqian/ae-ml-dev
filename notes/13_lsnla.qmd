{{< include _macros.qmd >}}

introduce FLOPs for matmat, matvec, etc.

introduce LU and QR, give pseudocode algorithms, matrix expressions, cost of each algorithm, give python code and show nonzero residual for LU and conditioning error for QR?

explain machine precision both double and single 

introduce the SVD in math, singular values vs rank/conditioning, explain the concept of conditioning in terms of being essentially non-invertible from the computer's point of view, cond/rank commands

show that normal equations are terribly conditioned.

pseudoinverse and truncated SVD for regularization

SVD + PCA??
